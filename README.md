<h2 align="center">I Love Coding and Learning</h2>

Throughout my academic journey, coding has always intrigued me, starting with block coding and progressing through high school classes to now developing full-stack applications. I'm constantly driven to improve, learn, and refine my skills to become faster and more proficient

I am proficient in using Front-end Frameworks such as the Vue Framework. I am also skilled in working with backend databases such as MongoDB or Sequel. The two languages I am most efficient at are C#, and javascript. I also have a certificate in Python.

I have recently graduated from Codeworks Academy in Boise, where I have learned invaluable skills. 
  
Throughout school, I maintained a GPA of 4.0 and always applied myself and I will continue to learn and improve.
