<h2 align="center">I Love Coding and Learning</h2>

Throughout my entire school career coding has intrigued me, from starting with block coding to taking classes in high school to now developing Full Stack applications. I am always striving to grow and learn to become faster and more proficient

I am proficient in using Front-end Frameworks such as the Vue Framework. I am also skilled in working with backend databases such as MongoDB or Sequel. The two languages I am most efficient at are C#, and javascript. I also have a certificate in Python.

I have recently graduated from Codeworks Academy in Boise, where I have learned invaluable skills. 
  
Throughout school, I maintained a weighted GPA of 4.0 and always worked hard and I will continue to learn and improve.
